Scenario 1: E-commerce Sales Data Analysis Overview

This project performs exploratory data analysis on an e-commerce dataset to understand product-level sales patterns, detect trends, and identify missing data issues.

Dataset

Source: Kaggle – E-commerce Data

Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carrie1/ecommerce-data

Objectives

Load and explore the e-commerce dataset

Review dataset structure and summary statistics

Identify missing values across different columns

Visualize product sales using bar charts and line plots

Tools & Libraries

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Key Findings

Sales distribution is highly uneven across products

A small subset of products accounts for the majority of sales volume

Several columns contain missing values that must be handled before advanced analysis

Outcome

The insights from this analysis provide a foundation for sales forecasting and data-driven business decisions.
